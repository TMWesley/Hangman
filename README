I'm creating a hangman game. Desired features:
Randomly generate many secret words, not just one.
Automatically generate the same number of dashes as letters in the secret word. Replace the dashes with the correctly guessed letter(s) in the correct position(s). 
Players who enter multiple letters, numbers and symbols recieve an error and are routed back to enter an acceptable single letter.
Tell the player how many guesses they have left.
"Draw" the hangman as the player guesses wrong answers.
